Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? The client was The Gaming Room. They requested the design of a web-based version of their game application, Draw It or Lose It. This game, currently available exclusively on Android, involves multiple teams with several players competing over four rounds. Each round lasts one minute, with a guessing phase for the selected image and a follow-up guessing opportunity for the opposing teams. The software must be cross-platform, ensuring unique game and team names, allowing only one instance of the game in memory at a time, and supporting multiple or single teams playing per game. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? My instructor mentioned that I surpassed expectations in developing and articulating the evaluations section of the documentation. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? Working through the design document was incredibly helpful when developing the code. It provided a clear roadmap of what needed to be accomplished, ensuring that all requirements were understood and addressed from the start. Having a detailed outline helped me stay organized and focused, breaking down the project into manageable steps. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? If I could choose one part of my work on these documents to revise, it would be the section on design constraints. Initially, I focused on listing the constraints without providing detailed explanations or context for each one. To improve it, I would elaborate on each constraint, explaining why it is important and how it impacts the overall project. For example, I would detail the importance of ensuring compatibility with all smartphones and how it expands the customer base, as well as discuss the budgetary constraints and the ongoing testing process to ensure the app works properly. Adding these details would provide a clearer understanding of the constraints and their implications for the project. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? When interpreting the user's needs, I focused on understanding their goals and requirements, ensuring that I could translate those into practical features and functionality for the software. I started by gathering as much information as possible through direct communication and feedback, which helped me prioritize the most important aspects of the design. I then worked on implementing these features in a way that was both technically feasible and aligned with the user’s expectations. Considering the user's needs is crucial because it ensures the final product is not only functional but also user-friendly and effective. If the design doesn't meet the user's expectations or address their pain points, the software could become inefficient, difficult to use, or ultimately fail to meet its purpose. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? My main approach is to rely on thorough research and study. Although reading documentation and exploring different strategies can be time-consuming and tedious, it ultimately helps avoid costly mistakes that can arise from rushing into something without fully understanding it. I break down the process into manageable sections or groups, using an approach similar to Agile methodologies. This method has proven to be the most effective for me when designing software. I focus on being as detailed as possible in each section because the more detailed the planning, the smoother the development and testing phases will be later on.
